Explanation:

1- What is the final title of your project? 

EcoArchive.org

2- What problem is this project trying to solve? 

People need an interactive and visual way to learn about endangered and invasive species around the world for better education and awareness of the public. This website would provide an interactive world map to use as a reference to ecologists, zoologists, and the general public alike. The map would show regions to find endangered species as well as archive general information about each species. Additionally, for people who capture invasive species to help the environment, the website would mark regions most affected by invasive species.

3- Who are your project's key stakeholders (including categories/subcategories of potential users/customers)? 

People who love animals and want to be better informed about different and invasive species. 

 4- What is this project's scope (boundaries, what is in, what is out)? 

The project’s scope is to create a website that informs people about endangered and invasive species. Allowing users to “adopt” their own endangered animal will make them feel connected to the species, leading them to take action and raise money and awareness to bring the animal out of endangerment.
