                        Hello, my name is Madison, but I prefer to be called Maddie. <br> 
                        I was born in jersey and then a few years ago I moved to Pennsylvania. <br>
                        I love the arts, but decided that pursuing an art degree is kinda useless. <br>
                        So here I am at NJIT pursuing an architecture degree.
