            Our mission is to provide people with an interactive and visual way to learn about endangered and invasive species around <br>
            the United States of America for better education and awareness of the public. Our website provides an interactive world <br>
            map to use as a reference to ecologists, zoologists, and the general public alike. Our map shows regions to find endangered <br>
            species as well as archive general information about each species. Additionally, for people who capture invasive species to <br>
            help the environment, the website would mark regions most affected by invasive species.
